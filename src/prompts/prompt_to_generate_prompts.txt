                Try to describe visual features or objects that are likely to be visible in such images, even if they are not stereotypical. 
                Make sure they cover as many of all the possible random photos that could be taken over that land-use/land-cover and 
                that they sound as objective as possible, covering different seasons and states of the land-use/land-cover. 
                Make sure to add some examples related to the class for the image visual description. Do not make poetic sentences but more factual."
